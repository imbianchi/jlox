## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the interpreter up and running:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/imbianchi/jlox.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd jlox`
3. Build the solution: `javac -d out src/*.java`
4. Run the interpreter: `java -cp out Main`

## Usage
Once the interpreter is running, you can input your own programs or use the provided examples from the *Crafting Interpreters* ebook. Explore the source code to gain insights into the interpreter's implementation details.
